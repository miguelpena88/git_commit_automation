**Github Commit Autommation**

In this project I will be building a tool that automatically makes daily GitHub commits using Python. The frequency of commits per day will follow a random number sequence from 1-10. All the notebooks and files I used for this project are available in this repository.

My approach to tackeling this project began by separating it into two main parts:

1. Automate edits to a notebook--this is needed before making any github commit

2. Automate the command line instructions that will be coming from script

*This project is still a work in progress and I will be updating this notebooks as I move forward with any update/revision*

**Background**

The idea for this project came out of necisity. As a data scientist searching for a job in the current job market, I could not spare to have my github contributions calendar overlooked by non-technical recruiters for having some areas of grey, or days of no commits; thus I made this project to boost my current github activity.

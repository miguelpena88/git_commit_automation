**Github Commit Autommation**

In this project I will be building a tool that automatically makes daily GitHub commits. The frequency of commits per day will follow a random number sequence from 1-10. All the notebooks and files I used for this project are available in this repository.

My approach to this project began by separating it into two main parts:

1. I have to automate edits to a notebook in order for it to be ready to follow the commit procees.

2. I have to automate the command line instructions that will be coming from script

Using the subprocess library to access the command lind
